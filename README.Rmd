# shinyExtendedTask

The goal of `{shinyExtendedTask}` is to demonstrate the use of shiny ExtendedTask API:

1. [Normal app](https://github.com/DivadNojnarg/shinyExtendedTask/blob/main/bad/app.R): slow, can't scale with multiple users.

2. [Extended API](https://github.com/DivadNojnarg/shinyExtendedTask/tree/main/good/app.R): send task in the background, can scale with multiple users.
